# ZCL_CAR ABAP Class

This repository contains the source code for the `zcl_car` class in ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming). The class simulates a car's basic operations such as driving and monitoring fuel consumption.

## Instructions

Follow these steps to use the code:

1. **Create the Class**
   - Open your SAP system and navigate to `SE24`.
   - Create a new class named `zcl_car`.

2. **Create the Attributes**
   - In the 'Attributes' tab, create the following:
     - `mv_car_tank` (public, type float)
     - `mv_consumption_per_100km` (private, type integer)
     - `mv_drive_status` (public, type integer)

3. **Create the Methods**
   - In the 'Methods' tab, create the following methods:
     - `CONSTRUCTOR` (importing `iv_car_tank` type float)
     - `set_consumption` (importing `iv_liter` type integer)
     - `get_fuel_gauge` (returning `rv_volume` type float)
     - `drive` (importing `iv_distance` type integer)
   - Paste the respective method implementations from the `zcl_car.abap` file in this repository.

4. **Activate the Class**
   - Save and activate the class.

5. **Create the Report**
   - Navigate to `SE38` or `SE80`.
   - Create a new program and paste the `REPORT` section of the code from the `zcl_car.abap` file in this repository.
   - Save and activate the program.

6. **Execute the Program**
   - Execute the program to simulate driving a car until the fuel is depleted.
